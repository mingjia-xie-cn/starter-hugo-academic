I am an assistant professor in Economics at Li Anmin Institute of Economic Research, Liaoning University. My research interests include health economics, education economics, and applied microeconometrics. My current works include the heterogeneous return to education, mediation analysis of the health effect of retirement, the effect of fertility on health utilization, and the effect of digital economy on labor income.
